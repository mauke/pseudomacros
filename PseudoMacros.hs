-- | The pseudo-macros in this module are meant to be used via Template

-- > import PseudoMacros
-- >
-- > main :: IO ()
-- > main = putStrLn ("Hello from " ++ $__FILE__ ++ ", line " ++ show $__LINE__ ++ "!")

-- That is, enable the @TemplateHaskell@ extension and put a @$@ before each
-- pseudo-macro.
